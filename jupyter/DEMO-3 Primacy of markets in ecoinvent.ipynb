    "## Truck Transport: A narrow market model\n",
    "Lorry Transport is something that's involved in every market process, which means it's involved in every \"outward-facing\" activity modeled by ecoinvent.  At first glance there appears to be a strong diversity of truck transport processes, but their breadth of empirical basis is extremely narrow and their usage within the database is highly limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate this by looking at the usage of all truck transport / market for truck transport processes in the database, and finding out which ones actually get used to model freight transport.  To do this accurately, we ignore consumers whose products are the same as the consumption reference flows-- these are generally market processes that are creating averaged freight transport models.  Then we show which processes are used and how widely."

      "Fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are taken from v3.1 of the HBEFA model, using the data for Germany and without applying model weighting. There are a higher number of size categories used in HBEFA than in ecoinvent and so the data are grouped in order to fit the lorry size classes used in ecoinvent. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology is around 3 times more common than that of exhaust gas recovery (EGR) as an emissions reduction measure and so the emission factors given in the dataset are weighted to reflect this. The data for the HBEFA categories SCR* and VI* were disregarded. The exhaust emissions caused by the burning of fuel are either fuel dependent (fuel type and quantity) or Euro class dependent. The latter reflect the emission regulations to which the vehicle complies. Regulated emissions are CO, NOx, particulate matter (PM) and total hydrocarbons (HC). Data from the Emissions Inventory Guidebook (EMEP/EEA, 2013) were used for specific exhaust emissions not covered by the HBEFA model. \n",

      "For road infrastructure the expenditures and environmental interventions due to construction of roads have been allocated based on the gross tonne kilometer performance. Expenditures due to operation of the road infrastructure, as well as land use have been allocated based on the yearly vehicle kilometer performance. The same assumption on vehicle lifetime performance has been transferred from the ecoinvent v2 datasets of 540 000 km/vehicle. The production, maintenance and disposal of the vehicle are as reported in the ecoinvent (2007) report on transport services. \n",

      "Fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are taken from v3.1 of the HBEFA model, using the data for Germany and without applying model weighting. There are a higher number of size categories used in HBEFA than in ecoinvent and so the data are grouped in order to fit the lorry size classes used in ecoinvent. The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology is around 3 times more common than that of exhaust gas recovery (EGR) as an emissions reduction measure and so the emission factors given in the dataset are weighted to reflect this. The data for the HBEFA categories SCR* and VI* were disregarded. The exhaust emissions caused by the burning of fuel are either fuel dependent (fuel type and quantity) or Euro class dependent. The latter reflect the emission regulations to which the vehicle complies. Regulated emissions are CO, NOx, particulate matter (PM) and total hydrocarbons (HC). Data from the Emissions Inventory Guidebook (EMEP/EEA, 2013) were used for specific exhaust emissions not covered by the HBEFA model. \n",

      "Non-exhaust emissions are accounted for as weight dependent by-products and exist as seperate datasets.\n",

      "For road infrastructure the expenditures and environmental interventions due to construction of roads have been allocated based on the gross tonne kilometer performance. Expenditures due to operation of the road infrastructure, as well as land use have been allocated based on the yearly vehicle kilometer performance. The same assumption on vehicle lifetime performance has been transferred from the ecoinvent v2 datasets of 540 000 km/vehicle. The production, maintenance and disposal of the vehicle are as reported in the ecoinvent (2007) report on transport services. \n",
